# GoogleDocumentsAutoReportGenerator
This project shows how to use Google Apps Script to create an automatic report generator for Google Docs.

The concept for this project came from my instructor, and in just three days, I built a website that uses Google Apps Script to quickly build and insert tables in Google Documents.
