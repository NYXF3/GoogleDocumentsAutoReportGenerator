Overview
This tutorial will guide you through creating a web form where users can input data to generate a report using Google Apps Script. The report will be created as a Google Document.

Steps:

1. Set Up Google Apps Script (GAS)
Create a New Google Apps Script:

Go to Google Apps Script and create a new project.
Name your project and save it.
Write the Google Apps Script Code:

3. Testing and Usage
Testing:

Save the HTML file.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to test the report generation functionality.
Ensure all inputs are filled correctly before clicking the "Genera Rapporto" button.
Usage:

Users can fill out the form fields with relevant information (e.g., Giorno, Comune, Ore, Operatori, Report).
Clicking the "Genera Rapporto" button triggers the report generation process.
A loading spinner will be displayed while the report is being generated.
Upon completion, the success message ("Rapporto generato con successo! (lo troverai nei Google Documenti.)") will be shown.
